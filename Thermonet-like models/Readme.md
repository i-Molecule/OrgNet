# Thermonet-like models training and inference

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for training, and running inference with Thermonet-like models. The training and inference of Thermonet-like models is organized into two notebooks:

- **Thermonet_like_models_training.ipynb:** Contains the model architecture, training routines, and evaluation metrics.
- **Thermonet_like_models_inderence.ipynb:** Provides scripts for running inference on new data using the trained model.
