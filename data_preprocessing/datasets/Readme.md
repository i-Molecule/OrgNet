### Datasets for Thermonet-like models and OrgNet

Original datasets files (Q3214.csv, Q1744.csv, Ssym.csv) have the following notation of destabilizing (ddg>0) and stabilizing (ddg<0) mutations. Initial datasets S2648.csv and S669.csv contained ddg values with destabilizing (ddg<0) and stabilizing (ddg>0) mutations. Thus the sign for S2648 and S669 was changed (S2648_fixed_sign.csv, S669_fixed_sign.csv) according to our notation of destabilizing (ddg>0) and stabilizing (ddg<0).

The correct datasets to reproduce OrgNet and Thermonet-like models are Q3214.csv, Q1744.csv, Ssym.csv, S669_fixed_sign.csv and S2648_fixed_sign.csv.
