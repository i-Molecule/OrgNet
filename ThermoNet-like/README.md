# Thermonet-like models training and inference

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for training, and running inference with Thermonet-like models. The training and inference of Thermonet-like models is organized into two notebooks:

- **Thermonet_like_models_training.ipynb:** Contains the model architecture, training routines, and evaluation metrics.
- **Thermonet_like_models_inference.ipynb:** Provides scripts for running inference on new data using the trained model.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed. The following packages are required (you may have additional dependencies based on your specific project):

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- **tensorflow** 
- jupyter
- etc

To prepare your datasets for Thermonet-like models use /OrgNet/data_preprocessing/ section.

Full python packages and their version can be found in requirements.txt

Thermonet-like models were tested on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS, AMD® Ryzen 9 7950x 16-core processor × 32, NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090.
